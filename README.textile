h1. "musiclibrary":http://github.com/kofuchs/musiclibrary

musiclibrary is a (very) simple Ruby application that I use to keep organize my music library info in a xml file. I also use a php script that reads the xml file and creates a nicer html page. 

h2. Information

* I use iTunes folder structure. If you use something else, you are going to need to adapt some code...
* There is a *config.rb* file inside the lib folder where you are going to point to your music folder and where you want to save the xml file.
* Inside the folder *musiclibreader* you may find the php file I mentioned before. If you decide to use this, you may need to copy the generated xml file or rename it to *musiclib.xml*

h2. Running

* Don't forget to check *config.rb* before you run the script.
* Just run the *music_library.rb* (ruby music_library)
* That's it!
